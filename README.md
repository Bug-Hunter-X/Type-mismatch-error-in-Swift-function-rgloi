This repository demonstrates a common Swift error: type mismatch in function arguments. The `calculateArea` function expects `Double` values for both `width` and `height`. The example shows how passing a `String` results in a compile-time error.  The solution shows how to properly handle string input and convert it to a Double before passing it to the function.
